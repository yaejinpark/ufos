Module 11 - UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview
Taking a break from Python, in this assignment, my objective is to create a static webpage that has a dynamic table for visualizing all or filtered data of UFO sightings recorded. Through this project, I was able to learn one method of visualizing data with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS (with Bootstrap).

## Results
The static webpage can be loaded by double clicking the index.html file icon, which will then open the static webpage on the user's default browser. There will be a jumbotron with a space image background and a blurb about UFOs, followed by a preloaded data of all UFO sightings listed in the data.js file. 

Since there are quite a few rows of data, user may lookup a specific record of sighting by filling out all or some of the input fields located on the left of the data table. Make sure to fill the input fields (especially the date) in the same format as the placeholders within the input fields show. The following images show the data table before and after applying a filter, respectively.



Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

Drawback - too many input required for one search - users are lazy
Recommendations - date-picker (calendar?) for date in input form or implement form validation in html, set up a simple database with MongoDB to store the data because with the current structure, it's hard to manipulate rows for comparison or deeper analysis
